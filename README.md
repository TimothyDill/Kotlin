This readme is to inform you of the following points:
My work is in consolemodule/src/main/java, not src as it was moved in migration.

* I am not a programmer by trade or training, jsut a guy figuring it out.
* I am always open to ideas for how to make my code better and improve.
* This is my first working repo, not just online storage. If something is not to a standard let me know.
* I did a force rebase of the file because I did not like having a single commit, then having one a few minutes later so if you can see path it may appear shorter than it was in reality. If someone is good at this and wants to teach reach out.
